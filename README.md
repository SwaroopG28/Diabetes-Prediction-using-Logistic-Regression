# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical data using a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and stored for later use in making predictions.

## Project Structure

- **diabetes.csv**: The dataset used to train the model. It includes various medical features (e.g., glucose level, BMI).
- **Diabetes.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that contains the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Diabetesmodel.pkl**: A trained Logistic Regression model stored in pickle format.
- **Predict.py**: A Python script for loading the trained model and making predictions on new data.
